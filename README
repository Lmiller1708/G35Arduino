Introduction
============

Here's the blog post that started it all:

  http://www.deepdarc.com/2010/11/27/hacking-christmas-lights/

This library makes it easy to replace the controller in these lights
with an Arduino, and to run much better light programs. It's pretty
easy to make new programs, too!

See a demo at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyKt7tHV-EM. There is also
a not-awful professional demo of the original, unmodified hardware at
http://www.geholidaylighting.com/holiday-lighting/led/color-effects.

Requirements
============

- Arduino 1.0 SDK. This code is not compatible with pre-1.0 Arduino.

- Any of the following: an Arduino or Arduino-compatible, a Teensy
  with Teensyduino or else flashed with an Arduino Leonardo bootloader.
  Also a plain Atmel ATMega of some sort, if you know what you're
  doing.

- At least one working strand of GE G-35 Color Effects Christmas lights
  that you are willing to slice up and solder back together again.

Installation
============

Find your Arduino IDE's libraries directory. Then unzip the project
archive into it. It should end up looking like this:

[Your Arduino documents directory]/
  libraries/
    G35Arduino/
      G35.h (etc.)

Then restart your Arduino IDE and you should see G35Arduino among
the libraries.

Upload the BasicExample sketch to your Arduino. You should see the
pin-13 LED flicker. Chop off the stock controller on your lights,
being careful to note the function of the three leads from the first
light (from left to right looking at the first light pointing upward,
they're V+, DATA, and GND). Put V+ on the Arduino 5V pin, GND on the
GND pin, and DATA on pin 13, and your lights should come back to life!

I've been happily running two strands on my house directly off the
Arduino (i.e., not using the stock power transformer) with an old USB
power supply rated 5V/1A from a Kodak Zi8. Your mileage may vary.

Contributing
============

Source-code contributions are welcome. If you think you might contribute
improvements back to the project, git clone into libraries/ instead of
unzipping, and to avoid going insane, check the "external editor" option
in the Arduino IDE and use a text editor directly on the library source.

We try to follow Google's C++ coding standards: 2 spaces, no tabs, 80
columns, and follow the existing naming/capitalization conventions in the
code.
