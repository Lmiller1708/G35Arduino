Introduction
============

Here's the blog post that started it all:

Installation
============

Requirements: Arduino 1.0. ***This is important!*** As of mid-
November 2011, the default download at arduino.cc is a pre-1.0 version.
You need to go to http://code.google.com/p/arduino/wiki/Arduino1 to
download a 1.0 release candidate.

Find your Arduino IDE's libraries directory. Then unzip the project
archive into it. It should end up looking like this:

[Your Arduino documents directory]/
  libraries/
    G35Arduino/
      G35.h (etc.)

Then restart your Arduino IDE and you should see G35Arduino among
the libraries.

If you think you might contribute improvements back to the project,
git clone into libraries/ instead of unzipping. We look forward to
your pull requests!
