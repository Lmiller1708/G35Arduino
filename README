Installing this library for your Arduino development environment:

  First, cd into your Arduino libraries/ directory. Then...

  - If you think you might contribute improvements back to the project,
    git clone git@github.com:sowbug/G35Arduino.git
  - Otherwise, just unzip the project.

Then restart your Arduino IDE and you should see G35Arduino among the libraries.
